This directory contains "BLL_SneakyWSL.yar", a generic Yara rule to use for hunting for the malware leveraging WSL found by @BlackLotusLabs.
I did a quick search for samples and I could not get a hold of some. I included main.cpp in this directory for testing on the strings.
If you have some samples, please reach out on Twitter @ManuelBerrueta, sharing is caring :)
